## Anchor CMS

Anchor is a super-simple, lightweight blog system, made to let you just write. [Check out the site](http://anchorcms.com/).

### Requirements

- PHP 7 (for now)
- MySQL 5 or Sqlite 3 (PostgreSQL soon)

To determine your PHP version, create a new file with this PHP code: `<?php echo PHP_VERSION; // version.php`. This will print your version number to the screen.

To upgrade your PHP version on OS X, just run `curl -s http://php-osx.liip.ch/install.sh | bash -s 7.0`.

### Install

	git clone https://github.com/anchorcms/anchor-cms.git
	cd anchor-cms
	curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
	php composer.phar install
	cd web
	php -S localhost:8080

Using vagrant

	vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
	vagrant up

Run the install wizard from your browser (http://localhost:8080) to complete the installation

### Testing

Tests are located in the `spec` folder.

	php composer.phar update --dev
	php vendor/bin/phpspec run
