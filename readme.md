## Anchor CMS

Anchor is a super-simple, lightweight blog system, made to let you just write. [Check out the site](http://anchorcms.com/).

### Requirements

- PHP 5.5
- MySQL 5 or Sqlite 3 (PostgreSQL soon)

To determine your PHP version, create a new file with this PHP code: `<?php echo PHP_VERSION; // version.php`. This will print your version number to the screen.

### Install

	curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
	php composer.phar create-project anchorcms/anchor-cms my-site --repository-url=https://github.com/anchorcms/anchor-cms

Run the install wizard from your browser to complete the installation

### Testing

Tests are located in the `spec` folder.

	php composer.phar update --dev
	php vendor/bin/phpspec run
