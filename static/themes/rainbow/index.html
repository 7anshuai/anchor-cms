							<p>Look, last night was a mistake. Daylight and everything. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. The interviews, unlike the rest of the show, are often edited pretty heavily. I had at least one that was WAY more awkward in real life than on TV, so thank goodness for some kind editing.</p>
							<p>Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! So, how 'bout them Knicks? I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. And why did 'I' have to take a cab?</p>
							<p><img src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/7ec15487856dbf285d695e5a4f8e12ef/tumblr_n6rzwbv3ji1st5lhmo1_1280.jpg"></p>
							<p>Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Say what?</p>
							<p>And then the battle's not so bad? Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Then we'll go with that data file! Robot 1-X, save my friends!  And Zoidberg! I just told you! You've killed me! With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!</p>
							<h2>Less Than Hero</h2>
							<p>Why yes! Thanks for noticing. So, how 'bout them Knicks? Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Can I use the gun? Yes! In your face, Gandhi! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.</p>
							<p>Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? &hellip;To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? &hellip;To shreds, you say.</p>
							<p>And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Also Zoidberg.</p>
							<h3>A Tale of Two Santas</h3>
							<p>Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? &hellip;To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? &hellip;To shreds, you say. Why yes! Thanks for noticing.</p>
							<h4>I Dated a Robot</h4>
							<p>Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? You lived before you met me?! Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?</p>
							<ol>
							<li>Can I use the gun?</li>
							<li>Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?</li>
							<li>And why did 'I' have to take a cab?</li>
							<li>And then the battle's not so bad?</li>
							<li>You are the last hope of the universe.</li>
							</ol>
							<h5>Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?</h5>
							<p>No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. No, I'm Santa Claus! I don't want to be rescued. Also Zoidberg.</p>
