				<p>Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Bender, you risked your life to save me!</p>
				<p>Ooh, name it after me! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it&hellip; then perhaps gifts! Can I use the gun?</p>
				<p>Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Do a flip!</p>
				<p>I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.</p>
				
				<blockquote>Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.</blockquote>
				
				<p>Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh&hellip; also, comes with double prize money. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.</p>
				<p>Then we'll go with that data file! And until then, I can never die? Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? File not found. Meh.</p>
				<p>Look, last night was a mistake. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? I never loved you. Belligerent and numerous. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!</p>
				
				<img src="//placekitten.com/800/600">
				
				<p>Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Daddy Bender, we're hungry. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. You know, I was God once.</p>
				<p>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Why would I want to know that? Ask her how her day was.</p>
				<h2>Spanish Fry</h2>
				<p>When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Shut up and get to the point! Shinier than yours, meatbag. And until then, I can never die? It's toe-tappingly tragic!</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?</li>
				<li>Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.</li>

				<h3>Insane in the Mainframe</h3>
				<p>Pansy. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Oh yeah, good luck with that. Can I use the gun?</p>
				<h4>Brannigan, Begin Again</h4>
				<p>Look, last night was a mistake. Professor, make a woman out of me. Ummm&hellip;to eBay?</p>
				<ol>
				<li>Pansy.</li>
				<li>When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.</li>
				<li>I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.</li>
				<li>Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?</li>
				<li>Oh, I think we should just stay friends.</li>

				<h5>Rebirth</h5>
				<p>You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Meh. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.</p>
				<h6>Mars University</h6>
				<p>Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? What kind of a father would I be if I said no? We're rescuing ya. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!</p>
				<p>Ummm&hellip;to eBay? Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Shut up and get to the point! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. For the last time, I don't like lilacs!  Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Look, last night was a mistake.</p>
				<p>Tell her she looks thin. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!</p>
				<p>WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Actually, that's still true. They're like sex, except I'm having them!</p>
				<p>Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Daddy Bender, we're hungry. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. You know, I was God once.</p>
				<p>Shinier than yours, meatbag. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! File not found. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!</p>
				<p>Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?</p>
				<p>Shut up and take my money! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Belligerent and numerous.</p>
				<p>The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Hey, whatcha watching? You are the last hope of the universe. Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Ask her how her day was.</p>
